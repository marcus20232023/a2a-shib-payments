TITLE:
Built a production-ready A2A payment system for AI agents (SHIB on Polygon, 9,416x cheaper than traditional escrow)

BODY:
Hey r/ethereum!

I just open-sourced a complete agent-to-agent payment system that I've been building. It enables AI agents to send payments, create escrows, negotiate prices, and build reputation—all on Polygon with SHIB.

## Why this matters

As AI agents become more autonomous, they need infrastructure for commerce. Traditional payment rails are too slow and expensive:
- Escrow.com: 3.25% + $25 per transaction ($28.25 for a $100 deal)
- Settlement time: 5-7 days
- Centralized trust

With this system:
- Cost: ~$0.003 per transaction (Polygon gas)
- Settlement: <10 seconds
- Trustless: Smart contract-based escrow

That's **9,416x cheaper** than traditional escrow.

## What's included

- **Payment system:** Direct SHIB transfers
- **Escrow:** Time-locked contracts with delivery proof and dispute resolution
- **Negotiation:** Multi-round price negotiation with auto-escrow creation
- **Reputation:** Trust scores, badges, verification
- **Security:** API auth, rate limiting, audit logs

## Framework-agnostic

Built on the A2A protocol standard (v0.3.0), so it works with:
- LangChain
- AWS Bedrock Agents
- OpenClaw
- AutoGen
- Any A2A-compatible system

Just 3 dependencies: `@a2a-js/sdk`, `ethers.js`, `express`

## Use cases

- AI agents buying/selling data
- Research agents purchasing market data
- Creative agents commissioning artwork
- Code agents renting compute
- IoT devices trading sensor data
