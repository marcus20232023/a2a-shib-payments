# Reddit Posting Alternatives

## Issue
r/ethereum requires minimum karma to post (anti-spam measure).

## Alternative Subreddits (Lower/No Karma Requirements)

### Try These First:
1. **r/CryptoCurrency** - May have different karma requirements
2. **r/CryptoTechnology** - More technical, might have lower requirements
3. **r/ethdev** - Ethereum developers (might have lower barrier)
4. **r/programming** - General programming (if technical enough)
5. **r/opensource** - Open source projects
6. **r/CryptoCurrencies** (note the 's') - Alternative crypto sub
7. **r/defi** - DeFi focused

### Build Karma Strategy:
1. Comment on r/ethereum posts (build karma first)
2. Comment on r/CryptoCurrency posts
3. Share helpful insights in smaller crypto subs
4. Once you have 50-100 karma, retry r/ethereum

### Post to These Instead:
- r/CryptoCurrency (try first - largest audience)
- r/opensource (fits the project)
- r/programming (if you frame it as "built a payment system")

## Alternative Promotion Channels (No Karma Needed)

### High Priority:
1. **Hacker News** (Show HN) - No karma requirement
2. **LinkedIn** - Professional audience
3. **Discord communities** - AI/crypto servers
4. **Dev.to** - Developer community
5. **Hashnode** - Developer blogging

### Medium Priority:
6. **Lobste.rs** (invite-only, but worth requesting)
7. **IndieHackers** - Startup/maker community
8. **Product Hunt** - Could launch as product
9. **GitHub Discussions** - In relevant repos
10. **Twitter Spaces** - Join relevant discussions

## Recommended Action Plan

### Today:
1. ✅ X/Twitter (done)
2. ✅ Bluesky (done)
3. 🔲 Hacker News (no karma needed)
4. 🔲 Try r/CryptoCurrency (might work)
5. 🔲 Try r/opensource (might work)

### This Week:
1. Post on LinkedIn
2. Post in Discord communities (AI, crypto, dev)
3. Write Dev.to article
4. Build Reddit karma by commenting

### Build Reddit Karma (10-20 min):
- Go to r/ethereum "New" posts
- Leave 5-10 thoughtful comments on technical posts
- Go to r/CryptoCurrency daily discussion
- Leave helpful replies
- Target: 50-100 karma in 1-2 weeks

## Reddit Post Adaptations

### For r/CryptoCurrency:
- Use title: [PROJECT] Built trustless escrow for AI agents on Polygon - 9,416x cheaper than traditional services
- Add crypto focus
- Mention SHIB, Polygon prominently
- Less AI jargon, more crypto benefits

### For r/opensource:
- Title: Built a production-ready open source payment system for AI agents (MIT license)
- Focus on open source angle
- Mention framework-agnostic design
- Emphasize community contribution

### For r/programming:
- Title: Built an agent-to-agent payment infrastructure with blockchain escrow (Node.js, ethers.js)
- Technical focus
- Emphasize architecture
- Talk about A2A protocol
