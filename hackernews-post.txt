TITLE:
Show HN: A2A payment system for AI agents – 9,416x cheaper than traditional escrow

COMMENT (optional):
Built this to solve a real problem: AI agents need infrastructure for commerce.

Traditional escrow services (Escrow.com, PayPal) charge 3-5% + fixed fees and take days to settle. For an agent economy with micropayments and instant transactions, that doesn't work.

This system uses smart contracts on Polygon for trustless escrow (~$0.003 gas), automated price negotiation, and reputation scoring.

Framework-agnostic: works with LangChain, AWS Bedrock, AutoGen, etc.

Open to feedback on the architecture—especially around dispute resolution and cross-chain support (v3.0 roadmap).

Tech: Node.js, A2A protocol v0.3.0, ethers.js, Polygon. MIT licensed.
